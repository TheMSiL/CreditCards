When you first enter the website, you have the opportunity to see what a random person's card list from the server looks like. By clicking on a card, you can view its number, see the list of purchases, or flip it to reveal the CVV code. After creating your own card, you have the option to choose between Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Your newly created card will appear in the card list, and the random person's cards from the server will disappear.
